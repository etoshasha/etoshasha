# 👋 Hi, I’m Sasha, an iOS Developer. And I'm open to work :)
- ⚪️ I’m also an ex-product manager in education.
- ⚪️ I code using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**.
- ⚪️ You can check out the repository for my receipts management app, [Spendy](https://github.com/etoshasha/spendy-app) (not yet released).
- ⚪️ I'm amazed by AI, education, web3,  product design, programming, accessibility features in modern devices and software, and just in general excited about technologies that make our life better today.
- ⚪️ My goal is to work on projects that will have a positive impact on people and make their lives easier in some way.
